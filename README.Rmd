## Installation

You can install the development version of epar from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("faithkwon/epar")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(epar)
compare_states(ma_2024, tx_2024)
```

```{r choropleth, echo = FALSE}
#choro(ma_2024, map_labels = TRUE)
```

Note: You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
